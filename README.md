# Phrase Processor

In this project, I created an ArrayList to store several phrases entered by the user. The program starts with a message asking the user to enter a phrase. If the user enters any numerals or the characters "@" or "#", there is a message saying the characters are invalid. I verify if there are any numbers using a regex to scan the string. The phrase will only be added to the ArrayList if none of this characters are present.
